      <h1>About DataStackGuide</h1>
      <p class="about-lead">We help B2B teams cut through vendor noise and pick data tools based on what companies are actually using.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>DataStackGuide is a research site for RevOps, sales ops, and marketing ops teams evaluating B2B data tools. We cover enrichment platforms, CRMs, intent data providers, cleaning tools, validation services, and more.</p>
      <p>Every tool page includes real pricing (not the "contact us" runaround), honest pros and cons, and job market demand data pulled from {totalJobs.toLocaleString()}+ analyzed job postings across {totalCompanies.toLocaleString()} companies.</p>
      <p>We track {totalTools} tools across 12 categories. Our data updates regularly from live job postings, so you're seeing current adoption trends, not last year's Gartner quadrant.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Why Job Posting Data?</h2>
      <p>Most review sites rely on user reviews (easily gamed) or vendor-reported metrics (obviously biased). We took a different approach.</p>
      <p>When a company lists "Salesforce" or "ZoomInfo" in a job posting, that's a buying signal you can't fake. They're hiring someone to use that tool. It tells you the company has committed budget, integrated the platform, and plans to keep using it.</p>
      <p>By analyzing thousands of these postings, we can measure which tools companies are actually adopting, which ones are growing or shrinking, and what roles and salaries are associated with each platform.</p>
      <p>It's not perfect. Job postings skew toward larger companies, and not every tool shows up in every posting. But it's a far more honest signal than a 5-star review from someone who got a free trial.</p>

      <h2>Who's Behind This</h2>
      <p>DataStackGuide is built by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/romethorndike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rome Thorndike</a>. Rome has spent over a decade working with B2B data and sales technology. He led sales at Datajoy, an analytics infrastructure company acquired by Databricks, where the team built managed analytics pipelines for revenue teams. Before that, he sold Dynamics CRM and Azure AI/ML at Microsoft, and covered the full Salesforce stack, including Analytics, MuleSoft, and Machine Learning.</p>
      <p>Rome also runs <a href="https://veruminc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Verum</a> (B2B data services) and <a href="https://getprovyx.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Provyx</a> (healthcare provider data), and publishes The AI News Digest, reaching 2,000+ subscribers with analysis on AI and data trends.</p>
      <p>He built DataStackGuide because most "best of" lists are pay-to-play, and review sites are easily gamed. Job posting data is a harder signal to fake. When a company lists a tool in a job description, they've committed budget and integrated the platform. That's the kind of adoption signal worth tracking.</p>

      <h2>Editorial Independence & Disclosure</h2>
      <div class="disclosure-box">
        <p>We believe in being upfront about how this site works:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Verum and Provyx are our companies.</strong> We include them in relevant tool categories and comparisons, clearly labeled. We apply the same editorial standards to our own products as we do to everyone else's.</li>
          <li><strong>Some links are affiliate links.</strong> When you click through to a tool's website and sign up, we may earn a commission. This doesn't affect our rankings, reviews, or recommendations. We list tools we'd use ourselves, regardless of affiliate status.</li>
          <li><strong>We don't accept paid placements.</strong> No vendor can pay to rank higher, get a better review, or appear in a comparison. Our data comes from job postings, not vendor marketing departments.</li>
          <li><strong>Our data has limitations.</strong> Job posting analysis favors larger companies and tools that appear in job descriptions. Smaller or newer tools may be underrepresented. We're transparent about sample sizes on every page.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
