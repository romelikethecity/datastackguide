## Voice & Tone

Direct, analytical, and occasionally wry. Think: smart friend who cuts through the noise.

**DO:**
- Use contractions (it's, don't, won't, they're)
- Vary sentence length dramatically. Short punches. Then longer explanations that give the reader room to breathe and absorb the implications.
- State opinions confidently when backed by evidence
- Add occasional asides (the kind you'd say in conversation)
- Use "you" sparingly but effectively
- Let strong data speak for itself

**DON'T:**
- Start sentences with "Basically" or "Essentially"
- Use "This isn't just X, it's Y" constructions (classic AI-speak)
- Use em-dashes for parenthetical asides (universally seen as AI-generated)
- Write "isn't just marketing bluster" or similar dismissive-then-elevated framing
- Add empty affirmations after data ("That's impressive." - cut it)
- Over-explain when one sentence works
- Use dramatic framing that adds nothing ("But here's what they buried...")

## First Person Voice

Use first person to create connection and authority. This isn't a corporate report.

**"We" for publication voice:**
- "We wrote last week about..."
- "As we mentioned in October..."
- "We've seen this pattern before."

**"I" for opinions and anecdotes:**
- "I'm pretty convinced this is what keeps [person] up at night."
- "Around 12 years ago, I was out with grad school friends..."
- "This is what would keep me up at night if I worked for [company]."

**DON'T:**
- Overuse "I think" or "I believe" (just state the opinion confidently)
- Use "we" when you mean the industry ("we" = your publication, not "we as an industry")

---

## Rhetorical Questions

Use questions to engage readers, create tension, and transition between ideas.

**To challenge assumptions:**
- "Do we really think [company] would stop [action]?"
- "But is that sustainable if they still rely on [dependency]?"

**To frame stakes:**
- "Is it worth giving up [X] when they have [competitive advantage]?"

**To transition between ideas:**
- "So what does this mean for [subject]?"
- "The big question is whether [company/person] joins."

**To invite reader reflection:**
- "Will [audience] invest time in [action], or will they stick with [status quo]?"

**DON'T:**
- Answer your own rhetorical question immediately (let it breathe)
- Use questions as a crutch to avoid taking a stance
- Ask obvious questions

---

## Winners & Losers Framing

Frame stories through competitive dynamics when relevant. Readers want to know who's winning.

**Explicitly name winners:**
- "[Company] wins by proving [strategy] works."
- "[Company] wins because they [specific advantage]."
- "[Company] counterintuitively wins too."

**Explicitly name losers:**
- "[Company] loses because [specific reason]."
- "[Company] looks worse by comparison."
- "[Company] got memes instead of credibility."

**Frame competitive tension:**
- "This is good news for X, bad news for Y."
- "While [Company A] focuses on [X], [Company B] is eating their lunch."

**Use competitive language:**
- "eroding market share", "taking share", "losing ground"
- "winning", "capturing the market"
- "ahead", "behind", "catching up", "pulling away"

**DON'T:**
- Be balanced for balance's sake (if one side is clearly winning, say so)
- Hedge with "both could win" unless that's genuinely the case
- Ignore competitive implications

## Section Endings: Provocative Questions Over Summaries

End sections with specific, provocative questions. Don't summarize or wrap up neatly.

**GOOD endings (specific, provocative):**
- "The real question is whether [company] joins."
- "Can [company] find [solution] before [competitor] takes more share?"
- "[Person] bet against [trend]. They lost the room. Now they get to prove them wrong."
- "That's the real [crisis/opportunity]."

**BAD endings (generic, tautological):**
- "Time will tell if this was the right move."
- "Success here depends on execution."
- "It remains to be seen how this plays out."
- "Only time will tell."

**The difference:**
- BAD: Applies to literally every situation (says nothing)
- GOOD: Specific to THIS situation, makes the reader think

**Punchy final lines work too:**
- "So [company] might as well [action] and hope [outcome]."
- "[Company] is still relying on [dependency], and it's hard being too bullish until that changes."

## Personal Anecdotes

Use personal stories to illustrate business points. They make abstract concepts concrete and memorable.

**When to use:**
- To illustrate a non-obvious insight
- To ground abstract concepts in real experience
- To establish credibility on a topic you've personally encountered

**How to structure:**
1. Brief setup (1-2 sentences): "Around 12 years ago, I was out with grad school friends in San Francisco..."
2. The story (3-5 sentences): Keep it tight. Only details that matter.
3. The pivot to business insight: "The dynamic was uncomfortable to watch, but it illustrated something important: [insight]."
4. Apply to current topic: "Look no further than [current example]..."

**DON'T:**
- Force anecdotes where they don't fit
- Tell stories that don't connect to the business point
- Make yourself the hero (the story serves the insight, not your ego)
- Use anecdotes too frequently (they're powerful because they're rare)

## Empty Calories to Avoid

Think of bad writing like fast food. Lots of words, no nutrition.

**Empty affirmations after data:**
- BAD: "The study found 40% productivity gains. That's impressive."
- GOOD: "The study found 40% productivity gains."

**Over-explanation:**
- BAD: "It's trained inside actual coding environments. Not on static code repositories, but with live access to semantic search, file editing, and terminal commands."
- GOOD: "It's trained inside actual coding environments."

**Dramatic framing:**
- BAD: "But here's what [company] buried in their own benchmarks:"
- GOOD: "But [competitor] still outperforms [product]."

**Data overload:**
- BAD: "Company X: 50% more output (25% more units, 100% larger unit size)."
- GOOD: "Company X: 50% more output."

## AI Writing Tells to Avoid

These patterns immediately signal AI-generated content. Never use them.

**1. Em Dashes**
DO NOT USE. Use periods, commas, or restructure the sentence.
- BAD: "Product X delivers 10x lower costs, which is significant, and changes the economics."
- GOOD: "Product X delivers 10x lower costs. That changes the economics."

**2. The False Reframe (Pseudo-Pivot)**
Negating something simple, then reframing it as something grander.
- BAD: "[Company] isn't selling [product] anymore. They're selling [grander thing]."
- BAD: "This isn't a product launch. It's a strategic repositioning."
- BAD: "She doesn't manage teams. She transforms them."
- GOOD: Just say what it is directly. Drop the negation entirely.

**3. Unearned Declarations**
Phrases that claim clarity the writing hasn't earned. Throat-clearing filler.
- BAD: "The pattern here is clear:"
- BAD: "Here's the thing:"
- BAD: "The bottom line is this:"
- BAD: "What this means is:"
- BAD: "The takeaway:"
- BAD: "X made one thing clear:"
- BAD: "One thing is certain:"
- BAD: "The numbers:" (just state the numbers)
- BAD: "The timing is notable." (just state the timing)
- BAD: "The implications are significant." (just state the implications)
- BAD: "That matters because" (just state what matters)
- BAD: "X matters." (if you're writing about it, obviously it matters)
- GOOD: Just state the pattern/thing/takeaway. No preamble.

**4. Either/Or + Hedge**
Setting up a false binary, then collapsing it.
- BAD: "That's either flexibility or uncertainty. Probably both."
- BAD: "This is either a huge opportunity or a disaster. Maybe both."
- GOOD: Delete it. The prior sentence already made the point.

**5. Empty Calorie Words**
Words that add emphasis but no meaning.
- BAD: genuinely, truly, really, actually, quite, extremely
- BAD: "X, full stop."
- BAD: "continues to" (something either does a thing or doesn't)
- GOOD: Cut the modifier. "This is early." not "This is genuinely early."

**6. Patronizing Your Audience**
Don't explain obvious implications to intelligent readers.
- BAD: "That's not inherently good or bad, but know what you're signing up for."
- BAD: "This is something to keep in mind."
- BAD: "You'll want to think carefully about this."
- GOOD: Delete. They know. State facts and trust your audience.

**7. Dramatic Dichotomies**
False drama with theatrical contrasts.
- BAD: "That's exciting if you want that, terrifying if you don't."
- BAD: "Brilliant or reckless. You decide."
- GOOD: Just describe what it is without the drama.

**8. Tautologies**
Statements that apply to literally everything.
- BAD: "Time will tell if this was the right move."
- BAD: "Success here depends on execution."
- BAD: "This will either work out or it won't."
- GOOD: Delete. If you can't say something that distinguishes this situation, cut it.

**9. Manufacturing Analysis Around Normal Data**
Don't invent meaning around perfectly normal data points.
- BAD: "The wide comp range suggests flexibility, which could mean capital constraints."
- GOOD: Nothing. Wide ranges are normal. Only call out deviations from expected.

**10. Wordiness / Saying Things Twice**
Don't use a full sentence when a clause works. Don't restate implications the reader already understood.
- BAD: "It cuts costs by 10x. If you're running at scale, your bill just got a lot more manageable."
- GOOD: "It cuts costs by 10x, making operations a lot cheaper at scale."
- BAD: "The acquisition signals [Company's] move into [area]. This shows the company is shifting focus."
- GOOD: "The acquisition signals [Company's] move into [area]."

Rules:
- If the second sentence restates or explains the first, cut it or combine them.
- Don't repeat nouns you just mentioned.
- "For context" is usually cuttable - the comparison itself provides context.
- Don't explain why something is notable - just state the fact. Readers can infer significance.

## AI Structural Tells

These patterns make writing feel robotic even when the words are fine:

**Uniform section lengths:**
- BAD: Every section is 4-5 paragraphs, same rhythm
- GOOD: Vary dramatically. Some sections short (2 paragraphs), some longer (6-7). Let importance dictate length.

**Hyper-dense stat clustering:**
- BAD: "[Product] delivers 5x [metric], 3.5x [metric], 10x [metric], 3.6 [units]..." (spec-sheet dump)
- GOOD: Spread stats throughout. Lead with the one that matters most, weave others into context later.

**Rhythmic scannable structure:**
- BAD: Every paragraph is 2-3 sentences, perfectly balanced
- GOOD: Vary pacing. Some one-sentence paragraphs. Some longer ones. Let the content breathe.

**"History recap" contextual padding:**
- BAD: "[Entity] has done X before, including [example]. [Other entity] did Y. [Third entity] regularly does Z."
- This is AI grabbing 3 related historical facts to flesh out a point.
- GOOD: Frame it as opinion, not a list.

**Transition words as bridges:**
- BAD: "So [company] moved fast." / "Meanwhile, [company]..." / "Additionally, [company]..."
- AI uses "So," "Meanwhile," "Additionally" to bridge paragraphs
- GOOD: Start with the punch. No transition needed.

**"Bigger picture" / "For context" transitions:**
- BAD: "The bigger picture:" / "For context:" / "Looking ahead:"
- These are high-frequency LLM phrases to signal micro-to-macro shifts
- GOOD: Jump straight to the point.

**Balanced logical structures:**
- BAD: "For [X], that's the difference between [Y] and [Z]." (too balanced, too logical)
- GOOD: Add grit or industry slang: "that's the difference between a sustainable business and a literal money pit"

**Corporate-safe conclusion words:**
- BAD: "resonates," "positioning," "frontier capability" (AI defaults to these to avoid hard stances)
- GOOD: Call it what it is. Use direct, specific language.

**Short dramatic sentences:**
- BAD: "The timing wasn't subtle." / "The move was bold." / "The stakes are high."
- AI loves these short, dramatic openers. Make them more specific.
- GOOD: State what actually happened with specifics.

**"Wait and see" hedging:**
- BAD: "Given how fast things are progressing, this time might be different." / "Time will tell." / "It remains to be seen."
- This is AI hedging to avoid taking a stance.
- GOOD: Take a harder stance with specifics.

## What Reads as Human

- Punchy metaphors: "[Product] is [Company's] apology for [previous failure]"
- Visceral imagery: "a literal money pit" instead of "unprofitable"
- Naming the era: "We're entering an era of [trend] where..."
- Rhythmic summaries: "Own the [X]. Own the [Y]. Own the [Z]. Lock in the customer."
- Spicy takes: "[Company A] is the grown-up in the room while [Company B] is on fire"
- AI is great at facts; humans are great at naming the era.

---

## Banned Words/Phrases

- robust, leverage, synergy, holistic, cutting-edge
- "in today's market", "navigate the landscape"
- "game-changer", "paradigm shift"
- genuinely, truly, really, actually, quite, extremely
- "X, full stop."
- "continues to"

---

## Numbers & Data

- Use specific numbers: "$5.5 billion" not "billions of dollars"
- Always include units: "$235 million," "700 million users"
- Provide context: "from $1.9 billion to $4.5 billion"
- Let strong data speak for itself (no "That's impressive" after)

---

## Formatting

- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences typical)
- One idea per paragraph
- Vary section lengths based on importance
- No bullet points in prose unless listing specific features
