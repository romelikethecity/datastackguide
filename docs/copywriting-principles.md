## The Three Rules of Copywriting

1. **Can I visualize it?** Concrete, vivid images stick in people's minds far better than abstract concepts.
2. **Can I falsify it?** Statements that can be proven true or false add credibility. "Rated best by 90% of users" is falsifiable; "We're the best" is not.
3. **Can nobody else say this?** If competitors could say the same thing, you haven't differentiated.

## The SO WHAT Chain

Feature → Functional benefit → Financial benefit → Emotional benefit. Write from the emotional end.

- "lots of money" → "$47,329"
- "many users" → "2,894 makers"

## The Slide (Direct Response Structure)

1. **Headline** (80% of the work)
2. **Problem** (quantify it)
3. **Agitate** (make vivid)
4. **Credibility**
5. **Solution** (transform)
6. **Proof** (specific)
7. **CTA** (benefit)

## Copywriting Fundamentals

- Write with your eraser. A great sentence is a good sentence made shorter.
- Don't exaggerate. An honest line always feels warmer.
- No one cares what you can do. Everyone cares what you can do for them.
- Avoid the passive voice. Use active, direct language.
- Don't kill your personality. The best brands feel "real."
- Avoid "landing page words": unlock, unleash, enhance, exceed, empower, supercharge.
- Find the tension. "Pleasant" gets forgotten. Conflict creates interest.
- Write how you talk. Casual, colloquial, full of pronouns.
- More periods, fewer commas. Short sentences. We like short sentences.
- Kill adverbs. Kill adjectives. Use concrete nouns and active verbs.
- Think slippery slide. Every line of copy should lead to the next.
- Your first line is crucial. If people don't read it, they won't read your second line.
- Copywriting is selling. Don't romanticize it. The goal is to inspire action.

## Conversational Copywriting

- Don't write AT the reader. Make it a dialogue.
- Use your customers' words. Your copy should read like your customer wrote it.
- Load up on personal pronouns. Use "you" liberally.
- Start sentences with conjunctions. It flows better. And it sounds more natural.
- Use contractions. Only academics say "you are."
- Empathize. Understanding your customer is more important than impressing them.
- Read it aloud at the kitchen table. If your partner cringes, rewrite it.

## Conversion Copywriting

- Get specific. You can't bullshit specifics. Specificity builds trust.
- Call out the type of customer you serve. People pay attention when they know something is specifically for them.
- Think "Call-to-value" not "Call-to-action." "Create Your Website" beats "Sign up now."
- Write for one reader. You're not talking to 1000 people.

## Landing Page Principles

### Above the Fold (5 Elements)

1. **Title:** Explain the value you provide
   - Explain what you do (when your product is unique)
   - Use hooks (address customer's biggest objection)
   - Own your niche (write with conviction)
2. **Subtitle:** Explain how you'll create it. Get specific. Introduce the product.
3. **Visual:** Let the user visualize it. Show your product in action, not fancy illustrations.
4. **Social Proof:** Adds instant credibility above the fold.
5. **CTA:** Make taking the next step easy.

### Below the Fold (5 Elements)

1. **Features and objections:** Make concrete the value you promised above.
2. **More social proof:** Let customers sell your product for you.
3. **FAQ:** Address features and objections that don't fit neatly above.
4. **2nd CTA:** Remind the customer why they're clicking.
5. **Founder's note:** Put yourself in their shoes. Explain their problem. Show the happy ending.

## Title/Headline Principles

- **A good title makes a promise.** Would you feel cheated if the content breaks the promise?
- **The caveman test.** A caveman should glance at it and immediately grunt back what you offer.
- **The two-second test.** "One Mississippi, two Mississippi. You get it?"
- **Under 8 words / 44 characters max.**

### Title Approaches

**1. Explain What You Do** (when unique):
- "Coffee-Infused Energy Bars"
- "Silence embarrassing notifications while screensharing"

**2. Use Hooks** (address biggest objection):
- Formula: Value → Objection → Value + Hook
- "You don't have to be an SEO pro to rank higher on Google"

**3. Own Your Niche** (write with conviction):
- "How Small Brands Sell More Online"
- "The All-In-One Toolkit For Working Remotely"

## Hero Section Best Practices

- Headline under 8 words / 44 characters
- Subheadline: Benefit-focused, not feature-focused
- Lead with pain or FOMO when applicable
- Be specific — concrete beats abstract
- First-person CTAs outperform ("Get My Brief" vs "Get Your Brief")
- Benefit + time formula converts well ("Become smarter in just 5 minutes")
- Address "What's in it for me?" and "How much time will this take?"

## Content & Growth Principles

- One great article is worth 50x more than 10 average articles.
- Build the best resource in a very tight niche.
- Distribution is 80%, creation is 20%.
- Focus on owned channels. Newsletter is the only channel you truly own.
- Direct traffic beats SEO traffic. Build something worth recommending.
