      "bottom_line": "Bombora's license fee is moderate compared to full ABM platforms, but it's a data product that requires other tools to be useful. The real cost includes whatever activation layer you run the data through, plus the analyst time to make sense of the signals. It's best suited for teams that already have a CRM and an engagement platform in place and want to add an intent data layer on top. If you're starting from scratch, you'll spend more on the surrounding infrastructure than on Bombora itself. Consider whether a bundled solution from 6sense or Demandbase, which includes intent data, might be simpler even if the headline number is higher.",

        {
          "q": "How is Bombora's intent data different from G2 or TrustRadius intent?",
          "a": "Bombora aggregates content consumption signals across a co-op of 5,000+ B2B websites. G2 and TrustRadius only track activity on their own review sites. Bombora's data is broader but less specific about purchase intent. A company surging on Bombora might be researching a topic for a blog post, not shopping for a tool. G2 intent is narrower but higher fidelity because someone visiting a product comparison page is closer to buying."

          "q": "Can I test Bombora before committing to an annual contract?",
          "a": "Bombora offers pilot programs, typically 30-60 days, that give you limited access to Company Surge data for a set of target accounts. These pilots are often free or heavily discounted but require a sales conversation to set up. Use the pilot to validate that their surge signals correlate with your pipeline activity before committing."

        {
          "q": "Does Bombora work for small businesses or startups?",
          "a": "Not well. At $25K minimum annually, Bombora is priced for mid-market and enterprise teams. If you're a startup or small business, you'll get more value from tools like SparkToro for audience research or Apollo's intent signals, which are included in lower-cost plans. Bombora's data co-op model is built for companies with large target account lists and existing go-to-market infrastructure."

        {
          "q": "What happens to my data access if I cancel?",
          "a": "You lose access to the Bombora dashboard and API immediately at contract end. Historical data you've already pulled into your CRM or data warehouse stays, but you won't get new signals. There's no export tool for historical intent trends, so make sure you're storing the data you need in your own systems throughout the contract."
