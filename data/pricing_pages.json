The listed prices are lower, but real costs are comparable once you add Microsoft 365, Power Platform, and implementation. The main reason to choose Dynamics 365 over Salesforce: your organization is already invested in the Microsoft ecosystem (Azure, Teams, SharePoint, Outlook). If you're not a Microsoft shop, Salesforce's larger ecosystem and talent pool are safer bets.",

        { "q": "Is Dynamics 365 cheaper than Salesforce?", "a": "On paper, yes. Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise ($95/user/mo) vs Salesforce Enterprise ($165/user/mo). In practice, total costs are closer once you add Microsoft ecosystem components, Power Platform licenses, and implementation consulting." },
        { "q": "Do I need Microsoft 365 to use Dynamics 365?", "a": "Technically no, but practically yes. Dynamics 365 is designed to integrate with Outlook, Teams, and SharePoint. Using it without Microsoft 365 means losing the main competitive advantage over Salesforce." },
        { "q": "Dynamics 365 vs Salesforce: which is better?", "a": "For Microsoft-heavy organizations (Azure, Teams, Outlook), Dynamics 365 is the natural choice. For everyone else, Salesforce has a larger ecosystem, bigger talent pool, and more AppExchange integrations. Our job data shows 1,694 Salesforce postings vs 65 for Dynamics 365, reflecting this market reality." },
        { "q": "What skills do Dynamics 365 roles require?", "a": "Based on our analysis, Dynamics 365 roles commonly require experience with Power Platform, Azure, DAX (for Power BI), and Microsoft integrations. Average salaries are competitive: $122K-$160K range." }
