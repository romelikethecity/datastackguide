It's best suited for teams that already have a CRM and an engagement platform in place and want to add an intent data layer on top.

Bombora's data is broader but less specific about purchase intent. A company surging on Bombora might be researching a topic for a blog post, not shopping for a tool.

If you're a startup or small business, you'll get more value from tools like SparkToro for audience research or Apollo's intent signals, which are included in lower-cost plans.

The trade-off is ecosystem maturity. Salesforce has 5,000+ AppExchange apps. HubSpot has a massive partner network. Freshsales has fewer integrations and a smaller talent pool. For teams under 50 people that need a functional CRM without the enterprise overhead, Freshsales delivers the best price-to-feature ratio in the market. Just know that if you outgrow it, migrating to Salesforce or HubSpot later is a project.",
      "faq": [
        {
          "q": "How does Freshsales compare to HubSpot's free CRM?",
          "a": "Both offer free tiers. HubSpot's free CRM supports unlimited users but limits features. Freshsales Free is capped at 3 users but includes built-in phone and chat. HubSpot's paid tiers get expensive faster due to contact-based pricing. Freshsales stays predictable at per-user pricing."
        },
        {
          "q": "Is Freshsales good for mid-size companies?",
          "a": "Up to about 100 users, yes. The Pro tier ($39/user/month) includes pipeline management, AI scoring, forecasting, and territory management. Beyond 100 users, you may start hitting customization limits that push larger companies toward Salesforce or Dynamics 365."
        },
        {
          "q": "Does Freshsales include marketing automation?",
          "a": "Not in the standalone CRM. Freshsales Suite adds marketing automation (email campaigns, journeys, web forms) starting at $15/user/month. If you need CRM + marketing in one platform, look at Freshsales Suite or consider HubSpot which bundles both."
        },
        {
          "q": "Can I migrate from HubSpot or Salesforce to Freshsales?",
          "a": "Yes. Freshsales offers data import tools and migration assistance. Simple CRM migrations take 1-2 weeks. Complex migrations with workflow recreation and integration re-wiring take 4-8 weeks. If you're downsizing from an enterprise CRM, the migration is straightforward because Freshsales is simpler by design."
