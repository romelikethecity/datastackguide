          "a": "Zapier if your team is non-technical and you need simple automations (under 5 steps). Make if you need branching logic, error handling, or complex data transformations. Make is also 3-5x cheaper at scale because Zapier's per-task pricing compounds quickly."

          "a": "Both have native integrations with popular tools, but they're often limited (one-way sync, basic field mapping). Integration tools give you custom logic, bi-directional sync, and connections to tools that don't have native integrations. Most RevOps teams end up needing Zapier or Make within 6 months."

          "a": "Reverse ETL sends data from your warehouse into operational tools. You need it if your data team builds models in the warehouse (lead scores, account health scores, custom segments) that sales and marketing need in their daily tools. If your data stays in dashboards, you don't need it yet."
