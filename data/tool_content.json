    "description": "Outreach is a sales engagement platform (SEP) used by enterprise sales teams to automate and manage outbound prospecting across email, phone, and LinkedIn. Reps build multi-step sequences that combine automated emails with manual tasks, and managers get visibility into activity metrics, reply rates, and pipeline influence. It's one of the two dominant SEPs in the market alongside SalesLoft, and it tends to win in larger, more complex deployments.",
    "description_2": "Where Outreach separates itself from lighter tools like Apollo or Instantly is in its enterprise features: deal intelligence, conversation intelligence (call recording and analysis), mutual action plans, and forecasting. It's not just a sequencing tool. It's trying to be the operating system for revenue teams. That ambition comes with complexity. Outreach has a steeper learning curve than its competitors, and the implementation process can take weeks. If you're a 5-person SDR team, it's overkill. If you're running a 50-person outbound org with complex workflows and need granular reporting, it's the standard.",

      "notes": "Pricing is straightforward and affordable compared to ZoomInfo ($15K+/year). The free tier is enough for testing. Essential at $39/user/month covers most individual SDR needs. Pro at $79/user/month makes sense for reps doing heavy daily prospecting. Annual billing saves about 20%."

    "pros": [
      "Fast LinkedIn-to-CRM prospecting workflow with browser extension",
      "Affordable per-seat pricing accessible to individual reps and small teams",
      "Free tier is functional enough to evaluate before committing",
      "Native integrations with Salesforce, HubSpot, Outreach, and SalesLoft",
      "Captures and enriches contact data in a single step"
    ],
    "cons": [
      "Smaller contact database than ZoomInfo or Apollo for bulk list building",
      "Email accuracy is good but not top-tier for all industries",
      "Limited value for teams that don't prospect from LinkedIn",
      "Phone number coverage can be spotty outside major metro areas",
      "Doesn't include intent data or advanced analytics"

    "best_for": "Individual SDRs and small outbound teams who prospect from LinkedIn and want a fast, affordable workflow for capturing contacts",

      {
        "q": "LeadIQ vs Apollo: which is better for prospecting?",
        "a": "Apollo has a much larger database and includes email sequencing, making it an all-in-one prospecting and outreach tool. LeadIQ is more focused on the capture workflow from LinkedIn to CRM. If you want a combined database + sequencing platform, Apollo. If you're a LinkedIn-first prospector who uses a separate SEP like Outreach or SalesLoft, LeadIQ's workflow may be faster."
      },
      {
        "q": "How accurate is LeadIQ's contact data?",
        "a": "Email accuracy is generally 85-90% for verified emails in North America. Mobile phone numbers are harder to source, and coverage varies. LeadIQ is strongest for B2B tech and mid-market companies. For niche industries or international contacts, accuracy drops. Always verify critical contacts before launching high-value outreach."
      },
      {
        "q": "Does LeadIQ work without LinkedIn Sales Navigator?",
        "a": "Yes. LeadIQ's browser extension works with regular LinkedIn profiles, not just Sales Navigator. However, Sales Navigator makes prospecting more efficient because of its advanced search filters and lead recommendations. Most SDRs who use LeadIQ actively also have Sales Navigator licenses."
