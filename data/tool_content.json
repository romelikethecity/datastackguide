        "q": "How does Nooks parallel dialing work?",
        "a": "Nooks calls multiple prospects simultaneously from your list. When someone picks up, it instantly connects the SDR to that live conversation and drops the other calls. The rep never hears ringing or voicemails. In practice, this means 3-5x more live conversations per hour compared to manual dialing."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is Nooks worth the cost?",
        "a": "The math depends on your outbound volume. If an SDR makes 150 dials/day and Nooks triples their live conversations, that's potentially 3x more pipeline from the same headcount. At $300-500/user/month, the ROI is clear for high-volume teams. For teams making under 50 calls/day, it's harder to justify."

      {
        "q": "How does Nooks compare to Salesloft or Outreach?",
        "a": "Salesloft and Outreach are multi-channel engagement platforms (email sequences, calls, LinkedIn, etc.). Nooks is purpose-built for phone outreach with parallel dialing. Many teams use Nooks for calling alongside Salesloft or Outreach for email sequences."
