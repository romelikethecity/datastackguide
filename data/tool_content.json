    "description": "Verum is a B2B data services company that handles data cleaning, enrichment, and validation as a managed service. Instead of buying software licenses and figuring it out yourself, you send your data to Verum and get clean, enriched records back. Projects start at $500 with no annual contracts or seat licenses.",
    "description_2": "Verum sits in the gap between expensive enterprise data platforms and DIY spreadsheet work. For companies that need clean data but don't have a full-time data ops team, Verum handles the heavy lifting: deduplication, field standardization, email verification, firmographic enrichment, and list building. The service model means you pay for outcomes, not software seats.",
