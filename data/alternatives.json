At $15,000-50,000+/year with annual contracts and credit-based pricing, many teams are either priced out or paying for more than they need. Whether you're looking for a cheaper option, better international data, or a different approach entirely, here are the alternatives worth evaluating.",

Most teams start evaluating alternatives 4-6 months before renewal, run a pilot of the replacement during the overlap period, and switch at contract end. The one exception is if Marketo is actively costing you deals through poor deliverability or broken integrations. In that case, eating the remaining contract cost might be worth it."

For deep attribution, most teams moving off Marketo add a dedicated attribution tool like HockeyStack or Dreamdata alongside their new marketing platform.

Without Clay, many teams use a primary provider (like Apollo or ZoomInfo) for day-to-day prospecting and a secondary provider (like Cognism or LeadIQ) for specific regions or when the primary misses.

      "opening": "Bombora is the largest independent intent data provider, powering the intent signals inside dozens of other tools (including 6sense and ZoomInfo). But it's not cheap, the data requires interpretation, and it's not your only option for understanding which companies are in-market. Whether you need a cheaper source, more actionable signals, or intent data bundled with an execution platform, here are the alternatives.",

Covers millions of B2B accounts globally.",
          "verdict": "6sense is Bombora bundled with an activation layer. If you're buying Bombora data and then manually routing it into CRMs and ad platforms, 6sense does this natively. The catch: it's significantly more expensive and requires organizational commitment to ABM."

LinkedIn's Company Engagement Report (free for Company Page admins) shows which companies engage with your content. None of these match Bombora's breadth, but they're useful starting points."

If you have a CRM, an engagement platform, and someone to analyze the data, Bombora can improve targeting. If you're going to dump the data into a spreadsheet and look at it occasionally, save your money."

However, 6sense's proprietary AI layer processes and scores these signals differently than raw Bombora data. Buying Bombora separately doesn't give you the same output as 6sense."
