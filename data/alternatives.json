Most teams start evaluating alternatives 4-6 months before renewal, run a pilot of the replacement during the overlap period, and switch at contract end.

Without Clay, many teams use a primary provider (like Apollo or ZoomInfo) for day-to-day prospecting and a secondary provider (like Cognism or LeadIQ) for specific regions or when the primary misses.

      "opening": "Bombora is the largest independent intent data provider, powering the intent signals inside dozens of other tools (including 6sense and ZoomInfo).

Whether you need a cheaper source, more actionable signals, or intent data bundled with an execution platform, here are the alternatives.",

If you have a CRM, an engagement platform, and someone to analyze the data, Bombora can improve targeting. If you're going to dump the data into a spreadsheet and look at it occasionally, save your money."

However, 6sense's proprietary AI layer processes and scores these signals differently than raw Bombora data. Buying Bombora separately doesn't give you the same output as 6sense."
