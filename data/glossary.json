      "full_definition": "Lead routing determines which sales rep gets which lead. The simplest approach is round-robin (each rep gets the next lead in rotation). More sophisticated routing uses rules based on territory (geographic or industry assignment), deal size (enterprise leads go to senior reps), product interest (route to the specialist), account ownership (existing customer leads go to their assigned rep), or lead score (hot leads get routed to top performers). Speed-to-lead studies consistently show that responding to an inbound lead within 5 minutes vs. 30 minutes increases conversion rates by 10x or more.",
      "why_it_matters": "Slow or incorrect routing kills conversions. A lead that sits unassigned for 24 hours has already moved on. A lead routed to the wrong rep (wrong territory, wrong product line) creates a bad first impression and internal friction. Automated routing eliminates the 'someone will get to it' gap and ensures every lead hits the right rep's queue within seconds of arriving.",
      "example": "A director of marketing at a 500-person company in Chicago fills out a demo request form. The CRM checks: company size (mid-market routing), industry (technology), geography (Central territory), existing account owner (none). The lead is automatically assigned to the Central mid-market AE, a Slack notification fires, and the rep's Outreach sequence starts a personalized cadence within 2 minutes of form submission.",

Duplicates happen when the same person or company gets entered multiple times through different channels (web forms, manual entry, data imports, integrations). Basic deduplication matches on exact fields (same email address). Advanced deduplication uses fuzzy matching (\"John Smith\" at \"Acme Corp\" vs. \"J. Smith\" at \"Acme Corporation\"), domain matching, and probabilistic algorithms to catch near-duplicates that exact matching misses.",

It's a composite metric that captures the health of your entire pipeline in one number. Improving any of the four variables increases velocity, but the highest-leverage move varies by company. Early-stage startups usually benefit most from increasing deal count; mature companies from improving win rate or deal size.",

      "full_definition": "Unlike first-party data (observed behavior) or third-party data (purchased from external sources), zero-party data is what customers tell you directly. Survey responses. Preference center selections. Quiz results. Explicitly stated purchase intent. Forrester coined the term in 2020 to distinguish this voluntarily shared information from data you collect through tracking or buy from vendors.",
      "why_it_matters": "With third-party cookies dying and privacy regulations tightening, zero-party data is becoming the most reliable personalization input. It's also the most accurate because the customer provided it voluntarily. The challenge is creating enough value exchange to get people to share it. Nobody fills out a 20-question survey for fun.",
      "example": "A CRM vendor's website quiz asks \"How many sales reps does your team have?\" and \"What's your biggest CRM pain point?\" The visitor answers willingly because they expect relevant recommendations in return. That data is more accurate than any third-party enrichment.",

It goes beyond lead attribution (which channel generated the lead) to track the full buyer journey across multiple touchpoints. Common models include first-touch, last-touch, linear, time-decay, and data-driven or algorithmic attribution. Each model distributes credit differently, and no single model is perfect.",
      "why_it_matters": "Without attribution, marketing can't prove ROI and sales can't identify which activities move deals forward. It determines budget allocation. Teams that can attribute revenue to specific channels and campaigns make better investment decisions. Teams that can't end up funding whatever the loudest executive believes is working.",
      "example": "A $100K deal closes. Revenue attribution shows the buyer first found you through an SEO blog post, attended a webinar, received three outbound emails from the SDR, saw two LinkedIn ads, and had a final demo from the AE. How much credit does each touchpoint get? That's the attribution question.",

The formula is (Opportunities \u00d7 Win Rate \u00d7 Avg Deal Size) / Sales Cycle Days. It gives you a dollar-per-day figure that represents how much revenue your pipeline generates daily.",
      "why_it_matters": "Pipeline velocity is one of the best single metrics for sales performance. It accounts for both volume (how many deals) and efficiency (how fast they close). Improving any of the four inputs increases velocity. It's more useful than pipeline coverage alone because it factors in speed and conversion, not just total dollar amount sitting in the funnel.",
      "example": "Your team has 50 qualified opportunities, a 25% win rate, $40K average deal size, and 60-day sales cycle. Pipeline velocity = (50 \u00d7 0.25 \u00d7 $40,000) / 60 = $8,333/day.

Good territory design balances opportunity across the team so no rep is overloaded while another starves. It directly impacts quota attainment, rep retention, and revenue predictability. Most companies redo territories annually, and it's a major operational lift every time.",
      "why_it_matters": "Poorly designed territories kill morale and revenue. If one rep has 500 accounts and another has 50 enterprise accounts worth 10x the pipeline, you'll lose the overloaded rep and under-challenge the other. Territory planning also prevents account conflicts, double-coverage, and customer confusion about who their point of contact is.",
      "example": "A 20-person sales team covers North America. Instead of splitting purely by geography (which creates uneven opportunity), you segment by company size and industry: 5 reps cover enterprise accounts nationally, 10 reps cover mid-market by region, and 5 reps handle SMB through an inbound model. Each territory targets roughly equal pipeline potential.",

The clean room enforces strict access controls: you can run aggregate queries and build audience segments, but you can't export individual-level records. Major providers include Google Ads Data Hub, AWS Clean Rooms, Snowflake Data Clean Rooms, and LiveRamp. The concept borrows from pharmaceutical research, where \"clean rooms\" prevent contamination.",
      "why_it_matters": "With third-party cookies dying and privacy regulations tightening, data clean rooms are becoming the primary way brands and publishers collaborate on audience targeting. They let you answer questions like \"how many of our CRM contacts saw Partner X's ads?\" without sharing your customer list. For B2B, clean rooms enable co-marketing measurement and joint account targeting between tech partners.",
      "example": "A SaaS company and a media publisher set up a Snowflake Clean Room. The SaaS company loads their CRM account list. The publisher loads their subscriber data.

      "full_definition": "A product-qualified lead is someone who's used your product (typically through a free trial or freemium plan) and hit behavioral thresholds that indicate they're likely to convert to a paid customer. PQLs are defined by product usage patterns: features used, frequency of login, team members invited, integrations connected, or data volume processed. The concept emerged from product-led growth (PLG) companies where users adopt the product before talking to sales.",
      "why_it_matters": "PQLs convert at 2-5x the rate of marketing-qualified leads because they've already experienced the product's value. For PLG companies, PQLs are the primary pipeline source. The challenge is defining the right PQL criteria: which usage patterns actually predict conversion? This requires tight integration between product analytics (Pendo, Amplitude, Mixpanel) and CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce).",
      "example": "A project management SaaS defines a PQL as a free user who has created 3+ projects, invited 2+ team members, and used the product for 14+ days. When a user hits all three criteria, the CRM flags them as a PQL and triggers a sales notification.",

Signals come from multiple sources: job postings (company hiring for a relevant role), technographic changes (company adopted a competitor's tool), intent data (researching your category), website visits (pricing page views), and firmographic changes (new funding round, leadership change). Modern sales intelligence platforms aggregate these signals to help reps prioritize outreach.",
      "why_it_matters": "Cold outreach converts at 1-2%. Signal-based outreach can hit 5-15% response rates because you're reaching companies at the right moment. The shift from \"spray and pray\" to signal-based selling is the biggest change in outbound sales methodology in the past five years. Companies like 6sense, Common Room, and RB2B are built entirely around capturing and surfacing these signals.",

The best account intelligence combines multiple data sources into a single prioritized account score or profile.",
      "why_it_matters": "Account intelligence determines sales efficiency. Without it, reps waste time on poorly-fit accounts and miss buying signals from high-potential targets. With it, teams can focus outreach on accounts most likely to convert, personalize messaging with relevant details, and time outreach to buying triggers. The difference between a rep who has account intelligence and one who doesn't is the difference between research-driven selling and random dialing.",

      "why_it_matters": "Poor data governance leads to three expensive problems: compliance violations (GDPR fines can reach 4% of global revenue), bad decisions based on dirty data, and duplicated effort across teams working with different versions of the truth. As companies adopt more data tools and collect more customer information, governance becomes the difference between a data-driven organization and a data-chaotic one.",
      "example": "A B2B company implements data governance by: designating Marketing Ops as the owner of lead data, requiring all tools to sync through a central CDP, creating deduplication rules that run nightly, setting 24-month retention limits on prospect data for GDPR compliance, and establishing a data dictionary that defines how \"customer\" and \"prospect\" are classified across Salesforce, HubSpot, and their data warehouse.",
